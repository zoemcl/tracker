Migration,Benjamin Renner,Suprisingly entertaining and cute. I enjoyed it.,3.5/5,2024-01-28
Past Lives,Celine Song,I watched this in late 2023 but wanted to log it because its the only movie I watched last year that really stuck with me. Absolutely beautiful. Realistic potrayal of love. Crossraods and choices. Balled like a baby.,5/5,2024-01-01
